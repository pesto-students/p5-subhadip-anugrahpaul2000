                I like how the economist Tim Harford put it, “Every time we say
                yes to a request, we are also saying no to anything else we
                might accomplish with the time.” Once you have committed to
                something, you have already decided how that future block of
                time will be spent.

              <p class="fontMedium">
                In other words, saying no saves you time in the future.

                When the 80/20 Rule Fails: The Downside of Being Effective

                How do you decide what the "Right things" are? One of the most
                trusted approaches is to use the Pareto Principle, which is more
                commonly known as the 80/20 Rule. The 80/20 Rule states that, in
                any particular domain, a small number of things account for the
                majority of the results.
                <br /><br />
                If Bezos had applied the 80/20 Rule in 1993 in an attempt to
                discover the most effective areas to focus on in his career, it
                is virtually impossible to imagine that founding an internet
                company would have been on the list. The 80/20 Rule will help
                you find the useful things in your past and get more of them in
                the future.

                In the center of the city there was a large bus station and he
                began his speech by describing it to the students. "Stay on the
                bus. Stay on the f*cking bus. Because if you do, in time, you
                will begin to see a difference." "The buses that move out of
                Helsinki stay on the same line, but only for a while-maybe a
                kilometer or two. Then they begin to separate, each number
                heading off to its own unique destination. Bus 33 suddenly goes
                north. Bus 19 southwest. For a time maybe 21 and 71 dovetail one
                another, but soon they split off as well. Irving Penn is headed
                elsewhere." "It's the separation that makes all the difference,"
                Minkkinen said.
                <br /><br />
                These ideas are critical, but The Helsinki Bus Station Theory
                helps to clarify and distinguish some important details that
                often get overlooked. The key feature of The Helsinki Bus
                Station Theory is that it urges you to not simply do more work,
                but to do more re-work. To continue the bus metaphor, the
                photographers who get off the bus after a few stops and then hop
                on a new bus line are still doing work the whole time.

                The jump from BS4 to BS6 instead of moving to BS5 and then to
                BS6. Below are the differences between pollution norms between
                BSIV and BSVI: BSVI or BS6 is the sixth emission benchmark or
                criterion in reducing pollution levels when compared to the BSIV
                or BS4 emission norms. From 1 April 2020, when the BS6 norm
                kicks in, BS6 fuel will also be dispensed across the country's
                petrol pumps from the same date onwards.
                <br /><br />
                With the BSVI norms, Selective Catalytic Reduction and Diesel
                Particulate Filter were included to assess the emission levels
                of the BS6 motor vehicle; however, this was not part of the
                emission norms set on BS4. Real Driving Emission has been
                introduced in the BS6 norms to make sure the emission from the
                motor vehicle is measured on a real-time basis. A BS6 vehicle
                has to use only BS6 fuel to achieve the desired emission levels.

                The Habit Tracker: What It Is and How It Works A habit tracker
                is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. So what
                should you measure in your habit tracker? Habit tracking can
                help kickstart a new habit or keep you on track with behaviors
                that you tend to forget or let slide when things get busy.
                <br /><br />
                You can track whatever habits you want in your habit tracker,
                but I recommend starting with these super small habits to make
                sure that you are at least showing up in a small way each day.
                How to Get in the Habit of Using Your Habit Tracker Despite all
                of the benefits, a habit tracker is not something that makes
                sense in every situation or for every person.

                Why False Ideas Persist There is another reason bad ideas
                continue to live on, which is that people continue to talk about
                them. Before you can criticize an idea, you have to reference
                that idea.
                <br /><br />
                As one Twitter employee wrote, "Every time you retweet or quote
                tweet someone you're angry with, it helps them. It disseminates
                their BS. Hell for the ideas you deplore is silence. Have the
                discipline to give it to them." Your time is better spent
                championing good ideas than tearing down bad ones.
                <br /><br />
                You have to ask yourself, "What is the goal?" Why do you want to
                criticize bad ideas in the first place? Presumably, you want to
                criticize bad ideas because you think the world would be better
                off if fewer people believed them
