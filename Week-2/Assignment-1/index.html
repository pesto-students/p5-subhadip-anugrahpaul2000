              <p>When you say yes, you are saying no to every other option.</p>
              <p>
                I like how the economist Tim Harford put it, “Every time we say
                yes to a request, we are also saying no to anything else we
                might accomplish with the time.” Once you have committed to
                something, you have already decided how that future block of
                time will be spent.
              </p>
              <p>In other words, saying no saves you time in the future.</p>
