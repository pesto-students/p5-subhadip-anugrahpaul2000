# Exercise 7.1:
### Reverse the Linked list

Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to reverse this list.

> Time Complexity: O(N)  
> Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1) 

> Constraints:  
1 <= N <= 104

### For example:  
    Example 1:  
        Input:  
          Linked List: 1->2->3->4->5->6    
          
        Output: 6 5 4 3 2 1
        Explanation:  
            After reversing the list,elements are 6->5->4->3->2->1
    
    Example 2:  
        Input:  
          Linked List: 2->7->8->9->10  
          
        Output: 10 9 8 7 2  
        Explanation:  
            After reversing the list,elements are 10->9->8->7->2
