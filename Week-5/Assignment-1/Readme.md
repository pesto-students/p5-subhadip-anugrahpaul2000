# Exercise 5.1:

### Create 3 functions, for example doTask1(), doTask2() and doTask3(). These three functions should be executed sequentially using both Async and Await.

### Execute these three 3 callback functions asynchronously using Async Await and Generators.

---

## Guidelines:

1. 2 functions should be created. One for Async/Await and the other one for Generators.
2. 3rd party libraries should not be used.
3. Custom Function should carry a meaningful name.
4. The program should execute without errors.
5. The program should achieve the desired result.
6. The program should take care of all 3 states of a Promise.
7. Should be committed to Git with meaningful commit messages

## Outcomes:

1. Under the hood understanding of how a Generator works.
2. Under the hood understanding of how Async/await works
