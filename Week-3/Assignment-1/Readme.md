# Exercise 3.1:
### Create a memoize function that remembers previous inputs and stores them in cache so that it wonâ€™t have to compute the same inputs more than once. The function will take an unspecified number of integer inputs and a reducer method. **(1.5 hours)**

**Example:**

## Guidelines:
1. The memozie function should be written from scratch.
2. 3rd party libraries such as loaddash or underscore should not have been used.
3. The function should carry a name which should denote the functionality of it.
4. The function should be able to take n number of arguments.

## Outcomes:
1. Understanding how caching works.
2. Why is it important?
3. The problem memoization solves.
